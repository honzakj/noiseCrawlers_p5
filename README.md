### Edited sketch needs to be started on local server in order to display default picture map! (without it browser doesn't have access to img folder) Otherwise you can simply open index.html that can be found and upload any picture you have on your computer
     

### In order to display the original sketch change line 5 of index.html to:
`<script type="text/javascript" src="./sketches/particlesDrawing/original/sketch_p5.js"></script>`

#### not that user input buttons and sliders wont work in the original sketch! (as there were originally none)
#### note that rgba images are not supported (can be opened but they do not work as intended due to their alpha channel)
