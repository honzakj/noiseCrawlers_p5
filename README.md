## Edited sketch needs to be started on local server in order to display default picture map! (without it browser doesn't have access to img folder)
## otherwise you can simply open index.html that can be found and upload any picture you have on your computer

### in order to display the original sketch change line 5 of index.html to:
`<script type="text/javascript" src="./sketches/particlesDrawing/original/sketch_p5.js"></script>`

#### not that user input buttons and sliders wont work in the original sketch! (as there were originaly none)
#### note that rgba images are not supported (can be opened but they do not work as a mask due to their alpha channel)
