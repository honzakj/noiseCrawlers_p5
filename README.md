### Edited sketch needs to be started on local server in order to display default picture map! (without it browser doesn't have access to img folder) Otherwise you can simply open index.html that can be found and upload any picture you have on your computer
     

### In order to display the original sketch delete line 6 & change line 5 of index.html to:
`<script type="text/javascript" src="./sketches/particlesDrawing/Original/sketch_p5.js"></script>`

#### note that user input buttons and sliders wont work in the original sketch! (as there were originally none)
#### note that rgba images are not supported (can be opened but they do not work as intended due to their alpha channel)
#### note that the image is stretched in order to fill the whole page (100% width, 100% height) which can cause distortion of the image. In order to get the right aspect ratio either use pictures that have the same resolution as your screen and maximize your browser window or resize your brower window to fit the correct aspect ratio
